# Problem statement :
In this project, task involves analyzing the content of the articles to extract key concepts and themes that are discussed across the articles to identify major themes/topics across a collection of BBC news articles.

# Project Summary :
The objective is to create an aggregate dataset of news articles across business, entertainment, politics, sports, and technology and perform topic modeling on this dataset. The purpose is to determine the best segregation of documents based on their topics. This can be useful for topic labeling or for understanding the characteristics of a large text dataset.
Topic modeling can be done using clustering algorithms such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). The resulting topics can be compared with the different tags available for the news articles to verify their correspondence.
Once the topics have been identified, they can be used for a variety of purposes, such as content analysis, document clustering, and recommendation systems. By analyzing the topics in a corpus of news articles, we can gain insights into the underlying trends and themes in the news. This can be useful for journalists, researchers, and anyone interested in understanding the news media.
